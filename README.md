# 12 Beginner Python Projects

Based on this [freeCodeCamp Python Coding Course](https://youtu.be/8ext9G7xspg?si=0wxN4enC_zf7KdcQ).


### [1. Madlibs](01_madlibs/)
The Madlibs project is a Python program that demonstrates string manipulation techniques, particularly string concatenation with f-strings, and user interaction through the input function. Users provide words and phrases which are then dynamically incorporated into a predefined Madlib template, showcasing how Python can generate personalized narratives based on user input. This specific Madlib adventure, titled "VISITING CHINA," serves as an example, where users input various details to create a customized story set in China.

### 2. [Number Guessing Game (Computer Version)](02_number_guessing_game_computer/)
The **Number Guessing Game** project demonstrates the use of the random module to create an interactive guessing game. In this game, the computer selects a random number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess that number. Through a series of input prompts and feedback messages, the player refines their guesses until they correctly identify the randomly chosen number.

### 3. [Number Guessing Game (User Version)](03_number_guessing_game_user/)
Similar to the previous project, this version of the **Number Guessing Game** implements two modes of playing: one where the user guesses a randomly generated number and another where the computer attempts to guess the user's chosen number. In the user-guessing mode, players input guesses until they correctly identify the randomly generated number, receiving feedback after each attempt. In the computer-guessing mode, the computer iteratively makes guesses based on user feedback, adjusting its strategy until it identifies the user's number or the user opts to quit the game. The project highlights key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, user input handling, and random number generation, ensuring an engaging and dynamic experience. Additionally, users have the option to exit the game at any time by typing 'q'.
