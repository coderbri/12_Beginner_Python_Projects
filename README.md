### [1. Madlibs](01_madlibs/)
The Madlibs project is a Python program that demonstrates string manipulation techniques, particularly string concatenation with f-strings, and user interaction through the input function. Users provide words and phrases which are then dynamically incorporated into a predefined Madlib template, showcasing how Python can generate personalized narratives based on user input. This specific Madlib adventure, titled "VISITING CHINA," serves as an example, where users input various details to create a customized story set in China.

### 2. [Guess the Number (Computer)](02_guess_the_number_computer/)
The "Guess the Number" project demonstrates the use of the random module to create an interactive guessing game. In this game, the computer selects a random number within a specified range, and the player attempts to guess that number.
