# 04 Rock Paper Scissors (v2)

This version of the **Rock Paper Scissors game** starts by prompting the player to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors). The computer randomly selects its choice from the same options. The game logic then determines the winner based on the following rules:
- Rock smashes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock

The result of the game is displayed in the terminal, indicating whether the player won, lost, or if it's a tie. Each outcome is accompanied by a message showing both the player's and computer's choices. Users can clone the repository, run the script, and enjoy playing the game. Feel free to customize or extend the code according to your preferences. This implementation provides a fun and interactive way to experience the classic Rock Paper Scissors game.

2. When prompted, enter your choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The game will determine the winner based on the rules mentioned above.
